    - Packaging fixes.
    - POD fixes.
    - Get rid of `Modern::Perl` dependency (add `Term::CLI::PerlFeatures`)

    - Force use of `Term::ReadLine::Gnu`
        `Term::ReadLine` *always* looks at the `PERL_RL` environment variable.
        This is a problem if your applications depends on not just
        `Term::ReadLine`, but features of `Term::ReadLine::Gnu` in particular.

        The way we can force the issue, is to make sure we override `PERL_RL`
        before loading `Term::ReadLine`.

        The workaround only works if `Term::ReadLine` has not been loaded by
        another module yet.

        Hopefully, this fixes the CPAN tests on FreeBSD as well.

    - Do not try to load Term::ReadLine::Gnu directly.
        Term::ReadLine::Gnu should not be loaded directly. Instead,
        the Term::CLI::ReadLine->new method will check whether a
        newly created Term::ReadLine object is of the "::Gnu" variety.
        If not, it will call "Carp::confess()".

    - Bad lexical scope for $has_terminator

    - Work around changed Getopt::Long 2.51 behaviour
        Getopt::Long 2.51 fixed its documented behaviour ("--" is kept
        in the argument list if "pass_through" is specified). Previous
        versions removed it. Term::CLI now checks for the Getopt::Long
        version and adapts where necessary.

    - Separate STDOUT/pager output for help a bit more.
        Also, set "status" to $? regardless of close() result.
        Some tests for status still fail, and I'm suspecting a
        race condition, making close() return "true". If this
        fails as well, then I'll just skip the test. :-(

    - Don't check STDERR on pager error.
        Something's off in checking STDERR when running an external
        pager. Could be race condition? Anyway, we only care about
        propagation of the exit status, so just test that.

        Tests work in my dev. environment, but fail about 30-50% of
        the time on CPAN testers.
