Need to build in "help":

 * Term::CLI::Command and Term::CLI objects accept a "help" text attribute.

 * Term::CLI will recognise the "help" command if it is not already defined
   as a command. "help foo bar" can be translated as "foo bar help".

 * Term::CLI::Command will recognise the "help" sub-command if it is not
   already defined as a sub-command.

 * Help text may be displayed through a suitable pager.
