# GitHub actions for Term::CLI Dist::Zilla build.
#
# Copied from https://perlmaven.com/setup-github-actions (by Gabor Szabo).
#
# Note the environment setting of `TERM` to `none`.
#
# When GitHub runs this pipeline, it sets `TERM` to the empty string
# by default. The `Term::ReadLine::Gnu` and `Term::ReadKey` libraries
# _really_ don't like that and start behaving weirdly. So weirdly, in
# fact, that `Term::ReadLine::Gnu` fails to build if you try to install
# it with `cpanm` without the `--notest` option.
#
# The "fix" is to set `TERM` to something that won't make the module choke.
# Strangely, the value `dumb` does not work (even though it has a valid
# `terminfo` entry), neither does `unknown` (which does not). For some
# reason, value `none` does work, even though it has no `terminfo` entry.
# Don't ask me why. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
