INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS FOR TERM::CLI


BUILDING FROM A TARBALL
=======================

If you downloaded the distribution tarball, simply install using:

    tar xzf Term-CLI-*.tar.gz
    cd Term-CLI-*
    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install

Building a Package
------------------

The tarball repository also contains a "pkg" directory with package
building information.

Currently, there's only an RPM spec file, so you can do:

    rpmbuild -tb Term-CLI-*.tar.gz

The output from "rpmbuild" should indicate where the RPM package
is written.


BUILDING FROM GIT
=================

Without Dist::Zilla
-------------------

If you cloned the repository, you can try to run:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install

Though that is *not* the same as doing it from the tarball (the
modules will not have a "$VERSION".


With Dist::Zilla
----------------

If you happen to have Dist::Zilla installed (and a lot of plugins),
you can do:

    dzil clean
    dzil build
    cd Term-CLI-*
    perl Makefile.PL
    make install

Building a Package

This is similar to the above, except you first have to build a tarball:

    dzil clean
    dzil build
    rpmbuild -tb Term-CLI-*.tar.gz
