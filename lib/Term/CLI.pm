=head1 DESCRIPTION

Implement an easy-to-use command line interpreter based on
L<Term::ReadLine>(3p). Although primarily aimed at use with
the L<Term::ReadLine::Gnu>(3p) implementation, it also supports
L<Term::ReadLine::Perl>(3p).

First-time users may want to read L<Term::CLI::Tutorial>(3p)
and L<Term::CLI::Intro>(3p) first, and peruse the example
scripts in the source distribution's F<examples> and
F<tutorial> directories.

=head1 CLASS STRUCTURE

=head2 Inherits from:

L<Term::CLI::Base>(3p).

=head2 Consumes:

L<Term::CLI::Role::CommandSet>(3p).

=head1 CONSTRUCTORS

=over

=item B<new> ( B<attr> => I<VAL> ... )
X<new>

Create a new C<Term::CLI> object and return a reference to it.

Valid attributes:

=over

=item B<callback> =E<gt> I<CodeRef>

Reference to a subroutine that should be called when the command
is executed, or C<undef>.

=item B<cleanup> =E<gt> I<CodeRef>

Reference to a subroutine that should be called when the object
is destroyed (i.e. in L<Moo> terminology, when C<DEMOLISH> is called).

=item B<commands> =E<gt> I<ArrayRef>

Reference to an array containing L<Term::CLI::Command> object
instances that describe the commands that C<Term::CLI> recognises,
or C<undef>.

=item B<ignore_keyboard_signals> =E<gt> I<ArrayRef>

Specify a list of signals for which the keyboard generation should be
turned off during a C<readline> operation.

The list of signals should be a combination of C<INT>, C<QUIT>, or
C<TSTP>. See also
L<ignore_keyboard_signals|Term::CLI::ReadLine/ignore_keyboard_signals>
in L<Term::CLI::ReadLine>(3p). If this is not specified, C<QUIT>
keyboard generation is turned off by default.

=item B<name> =E<gt> I<Str>

The application name. This is used for e.g. the history file
and default command prompt.

If not given, defaults to C<$FindBin::Script> (see L<FindBin>(3p)).

=item B<prompt> =E<gt> I<Str>

Prompt to display when L<readline|/readline> is called. Defaults
to the application name with C<E<gt>> and a space appended.

=item B<skip> =E<gt> I<RegEx>

Set the object's L<skip|/skip> attribute, telling the
L<readline|/readline> method to ignore input lines
that match the given I<RegEx>.
A common call value is C<qr{^\s+(?:#.*)$}> to skip
empty lines, lines with only whitespace, and comments.

=item B<history_file> =E<gt> I<Str>

Specify the file to read/write input history to/from.
The default is I<name> + C<_history> in the user's
I<HOME> directory.

=item B<history_lines> =E<gt> I<Int>

Maximum number of lines to keep in the input history.
Default is 1000.

=head1 INHERITED METHODS

This class inherits all the attributes and accessors of
L<Term::CLI::Role::CommandSet>(3p) and L<Term::CLI::Base>(3p),
most notably:

=head2 Accessors

=over

=item B<has_callback>
X<has_callback>

See
L<has_callback in Term::CLI::Role::CommandSet|Term::CLI::Role::CommandSet/has_callback>.

=item B<callback> ( [ I<CodeRef> ] )
X<callback>

See
L<callback in Term::CLI::Role::CommandSet|Term::CLI::Role::CommandSet/callback>.

=item B<has_commands>
X<has_commands>

See
L<has_commands in Term::CLI::Role::CommandSet|Term::CLI::Role::CommandSet/has_commands>.

=item B<commands> ( [ I<ArrayRef> ] )
X<commands>

See
L<commands in Term::CLI::Role::CommandSet|Term::CLI::Role::CommandSet/commands>.

I<ArrayRef> with C<Term::CLI::Command> object instances.

=back

=head2 Others

=over

=item B<has_cleanup>
X<has_cleanup>

Predicate function that returns whether or not the C<cleanup> attribute has been set.

=item B<cleanup> ( [ I<CodeRef> ] )

Gets or sets a reference to a subroutine that should be called when the object
is destroyed (i.e. in L<Moo> terminology, when C<DEMOLISH> is called).

The code is called with one parameter: the object to be destroyed. One typical
use of C<cleanup> is to ensure that the history gets saved upon exit:

  my $cli = Term::CLI->new(
    ...
    cleanup => sub {
      my ($cli) = @_;
      $cli->write_history
        or warn "cannot write history: ".$cli->error."\n";
    }
  );

=item B<find_command> ( I<Str> )
X<find_command>

See
L<find_command in Term::CLI::Role::CommandSet|Term::CLI::Role::CommandSet/find_command>.

=item B<find_matches> ( I<Str> )
X<find_matches>

See
L<find_matches in Term::CLI::Role::CommandSet|Term::CLI::Role::CommandSet/find_matches>.

=back

=head1 METHODS

=head2 Accessors

=over

=item B<name>
X<name>

The application name.
See
L<name in Term::CLI::Base|Term::CLI::Base/name>.

=item B<prompt> ( [ I<Str> ] )
X<prompt>

Get or set the command line prompt to display to the user.

=item B<term>
X<term>

Return a reference to the underlying L<Term::CLI::ReadLine> object.
See
L<term in Term::CLI::Base|Term::CLI::Base/term>.

=item B<quote_characters> ( [ I<Str> ] )
X<quote_characters>

Get or set the characters that should considered quote characters
for the completion and parsing/execution routines.

Default is C<'">, that is a single quote or a double quote.

It's possible to change this, but this will interfere with the default
splitting function, so if you do want custom quote characters, you should
also override the L<split_function|/split_function>.

=item B<split_function> ( [ I<CodeRef> ] )

Get or set the function that is used to split a (partial) command
line into words. The default function uses
L<Text::ParseWords::parse_line|Text::ParseWords/parse_line>.
Note that this implies that it can take into account custom delimiters,
but I<not custom quote characters>.

The I<CodeRef> is called as:

    ( ERROR, [ WORD, ... ] ) = CodeRef->( CLI_OBJ, TEXT )

The function should return a list of at least one element, an
I<ERROR> string. Subsequent elements are the words resulting
from the split.

I<ERROR> string should be empty (not C<undef>!) if splitting
was successful, otherwise it should contain a relevant error
message.

=item B<word_delimiters> ( [ I<Str> ] )

Get or set the characters that are considered word delimiters
in the completion and parsing/execution routines.

Default is C< \t\n>, that is I<space>, I<tab>, and I<newline>.

The first character in the string is also the character that is
appended to a completed word at the command line prompt.

=back

=head2 History Control

=over

=item B<history_lines> ( [ I<Int> ] )

Get or set the maximum number of lines to keep in the history.
Default is 1000.

=item B<history_file> ( [ I<Str> ] )

Set the default file to read from/write to.

=item B<read_history> ( [ I<Str> ] )

Try to read input history from the L<history_file()|/history_file>.
Returns 1 on success. On failure, it will set the L<error|/error>
field and return C<undef>.

If I<Str> is given, it will try to read from that file instead. If that is
successful, the L<history_file()|/history_file> attribute will be set
to I<Str>.

=item B<write_history> ( [ I<Str> ] )

Try to write the input history to the L<history_file()|/history_file>.
Returns 1 on success. On failure, it will set the L<error|/error> field
and return C<undef>.

If I<Str> is given, it will try to write to that file instead. If that is
successful, the L<history_file()|/history_file> attribute will be set
to I<Str>.

=back

=head2 Others

=over

=item B<complete_line> ( I<TEXT>, I<LINE>, I<START> )
X<complete_line>

Called when the user hits the I<TAB> key for completion.

I<TEXT> is the text to complete, I<LINE> is the input line so
far, I<START> is the position in the line where I<TEXT> starts.

The function will split the line in words and delegate the
completion to the first L<Term::CLI::Command> sub-command,
see L<Term::CLI::Command|Term::CLI::Command/complete_line>.

=item B<readline> ( [ I<ATTR> =E<gt> I<VAL>, ... ] )
X<readline>

Read a line from the input connected to L<term|/term>, using
the L<Term::ReadLine> interface.

By default, it returns the line read from the input, or
an empty value if end of file has been reached (e.g.
the user hitting I<Ctrl-D>).

The following I<ATTR> are recognised:

=over

=item B<skip> =E<gt> I<RegEx>

Override the object's L<skip|/skip> attribute.

Skip lines that match the I<RegEx> parameter. A common
call is:

    $text = CLI->readline( skip => qr{^\s+(?:#.*)$} );

This will skip empty lines, lines containing whitespace, and
comments.

=item B<prompt> =E<gt> I<Str>

Override the prompt given by the L<prompt|/prompt> method.

=back

Examples:

    # Just read the next input line.
    $line = $cli->readline;
    exit if !defined $line;

    # Skip empty lines and comments.
    $line = $cli->readline( skip => qr{^\s*(?:#.*)?$} );
    exit if !defined $line;

=item B<execute> ( I<Str> )
X<execute>

Parse and execute the command line consisting of I<Str>
(see the return value of L<readline|/readline> above).

The command line is split into words using
the L<split_function|/split_function>.
If that succeeds, then the resulting list of words is
parsed and executed, otherwise a parse error is generated
(i.e. the object's L<callback|Term::CLI::Role::CommandSet/callback>
function is called with a C<status> of C<-1> and a suitable C<error>
field).

For specifying a custom word splitting method, see
L<split_function|/split_function>.

Example:

    while (my $line = $cli->readline(skip => qr/^\s*(?:#.*)?$/)) {
        $cli->execute($line);
    }

The command line is parsed depth-first, and for every
L<Term::CLI::Command>(3p) encountered, that object's
L<callback|Term::CLI::Role::CommandSet/callback> function
is executed (see
L<callback in Term::CLI::Role::Command|Term::CLI::Role::CommandSet/callback>).

The C<execute> function returns the results of the last called callback
function.

=over

=item *

Suppose that the C<file> command has a C<show> sub-command that takes
an optional C<--verbose> option and a single file argument.

=item *

Suppose the input is:

    file show --verbose foo.txt

=item *

Then the parse tree looks like this:

    (cli-root)
        |
        +--> Command 'file'
                |
                +--> Command 'show'
                        |
                        +--> Option '--verbose'
                        |
                        +--> Argument 'foo.txt'

=item *

Then the callbacks will be called in the following order:

=over

=item 1.

Callback for 'show'

=item 2.

Callback for 'file'

=item 3.

Callback for C<Term::CLI> object.

=back

The return value from each L<callback|Term::CLI::Role::CommandSet/callback>
(a hash in list form) is fed into the next callback function in the
chain. This allows for adding custom data to the return hash that will
be fed back up the parse tree (and eventually to the caller).

=head1 SIGNAL HANDLING

The C<Term::CLI> object (through L<Term::CLI::ReadLine>) will make sure that
signals are handled "correctly". This especially means that if a signal is
not ignored, the terminal is left in a "sane" state before any signal
handler is called or the program exits.

See also
L<SIGNAL HANDLING in Term::CLI::ReadLine|Term::CLI::ReadLine/SIGNAL HANDLING>.

=begin __PODCOVERAGE

=head1 THIS SECTION SHOULD BE HIDDEN

This section is meant for methods that should not be considered
for coverage. This typically includes things like BUILD and DEMOLISH from
Moo/Moose. It is possible to skip these when using the Pod::Coverage class
(using C<also_private>), but this is not an option when running C<cover>
from the command line.

The simplest trick is to add a hidden section with an item list containing
these methods.
