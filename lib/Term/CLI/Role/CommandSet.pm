=head1 NAME

Term::CLI::Role::CommandSet - Role for (sub-)commands in Term::CLI

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 package Term::CLI::Command {

    use Moo;

    with('Term::CLI::Role::CommandSet');

    ...
 };

 my $cmd = Term::CLI::Command->new( ... );

 $cmd->callback->( %args ) if $cmd->has_callback;

 if ( $cmd->has_commands ) {
    my $cmd_ref = $cmd->find_command( $cmd_name );
    die $cmd->error unless $cmd_ref;
 }

 say "command names:", join(', ', $cmd->command_names);

 $cmd->callback->( $cmd, %args ) if $cmd->has_callback;

 %args = $cmd->try_callback( %args );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Role for L<Term::CLI>(3p) elements that contain
a set of L<Term::CLI::Command>(3p) objects.

This role is used by L<Term::CLI>(3p) and L<Term::CLI::Command>(3p).

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

This role defines two additional attributes:

=over

=item B<commands> =E<gt> I<ArrayRef>

Reference to an array containing C<Term::CLI::Command> object
instances that describe the sub-commands that the command takes,
or C<undef>.

Note that the elements of the array are copied over to an internal
array, so modifications to the I<ArrayRef> will not be seen.

=item B<callback> =E<gt> I<CodeRef>

Reference to a subroutine that should be called when the command
is executed, or C<undef>.

=back

=head1 ACCESSORS AND PREDICATES

=over

=item B<has_callback>
X<has_callback>

=item B<has_commands>
X<has_commands>

Predicate functions that return whether or not any (sub-)commands
have been added to this object.

=item B<callback> ( [ I<CODEREF> ] )
X<callback>

I<CODEREF> to be called when the command is executed. The callback
is called as:

   OBJ->callback->(OBJ,
        status       => Int,
        error        => Str,
        options      => HashRef,
        arguments    => ArrayRef[Value],
        command_line => Str,
        command_path => ArrayRef[InstanceOf['Term::CLI::Command']],
   );

Where:

=over

=item I<CLI_REF>

Reference to the current C<Term::CLI> object.

=item C<status>

Indicates the status of parsing/execution so far.
It has the following meanings:

=over

=item I<E<lt> 0>

Negative status values indicate a parse error. This is a sign that no
action should be taken, but some error handling should be performed.
The actual parse error can be found under the C<error> key. A typical
thing to do in this case is for one of the callbacks in the chain (e.g.
the one on the C<Term::CLI> object) to print the error to F<STDERR>.

=item I<0>

The command line parses as valid and execution so far has been successful.

=item I<E<gt> 0>

Some error occurred in the execution of the action. Callback functions need
to set this by themselves.

=back

=item C<error>

In case of a negative C<status>, this will contain the parse error. In
all other cases, it may or may not contain useful information.

=item C<options>

Reference to a hash containing all command line options.
Compatible with the options hash as set by L<Getopt::Long>(3p).

=item C<arguments>

Reference to an array containing all the arguments to the command.
Each value is a scalar value, possibly converted by
its corresponding L<Term::CLI::Argument>'s
L<validate|Term::CLI::Argument/validate> method (e.g. C<3e-1> may have
been converted to C<0.3>).

=item C<unparsed>

Reference to an array containing all the words on the command line that
have not been parsed as arguments or sub-commands yet. In case of parse
errors, this often contains elements, and otherwise should be empty.

=item C<command_line>

The complete command line as given to the
L<Term::CLI::execute|Term::CLI/execute> method.

=item C<command_path>

Reference to an array containing the "parse tree", i.e. a list
of object references:

    [
        InstanceOf['Term::CLI'],
        InstanceOf['Term::CLI::Command'],
        ...
    ]

The first item in the C<command_path> list is always the top-level
L<Term::CLI> object, while the last is always the same as the
I<OBJ_REF> parameter.

=back

The callback is expected to return a hash (list) containing at least the
same keys. The C<command_path>, C<arguments>, and C<options> should
be considered read-only.

Note that a callback can be called even in the case of errors, so you
should always check the C<status> before doing anything.

=item B<commands>
X<commands>

Return the list of subordinate C<Term::CLI::Command> objects
(i.e. "sub-commands") sorted on C<name>.

=item B<parent>
X<parent>

Return a reference to the object that "owns" this object.
This is typically another object class that consumes this
C<Term::CLI::Role::CommandSet> role, such as
C<Term::CLI>(3p) or C<Term::CLI::Command>(3p), or C<undef>.

=back

=head1 METHODS

=over

=item B<add_command> ( I<CMD_REF>, ... )
X<add_command>

Add the given I<CMD_REF> command(s) to the list of (sub-)commands, setting
each I<CMD_REF>'s L<parent|/parent> in the process.

=item B<command_names>
X<command_names>

Return the list of (sub-)command names, sorted alphabetically.

=item B<find_matches> ( I<Str> )
X<find_matches>

Return a list of all commands in this object that match the I<Str>
prefix.

=item B<find_command> ( I<Str> )
X<find_command>

Check whether I<Str> uniquely matches a command in this C<Term::CLI>
object. Returns a reference to the appropriate
L<Term::CLI::Command> object if successful; otherwise, it
sets the objects C<error> field and returns C<undef>.

Example:

    my $sub_cmd = $cmd->find_command($prefix);
    die $cmd->error unless $sub_cmd;

=item B<root_node>
X<root_node>

Walks L<parent|/parent> chain until it can go no further. Returns a
reference to the object at the top. In a functional setup, this
is expected to be a L<Term::CLI>(3p) object.

=item B<try_callback> ( I<ARGS> )
X<try_callback>

Wrapper function that will call the object's C<callback> function if it
has been set, otherwise simply returns its arguments.

=begin __PODCOVERAGE

=head1 THIS SECTION SHOULD BE HIDDEN

This section is meant for methods that should not be considered
for coverage. This typically includes things like BUILD and DEMOLISH from
Moo/Moose. It is possible to skip these when using the Pod::Coverage class
(using C<also_private>), but this is not an option when running C<cover>
from the command line.

The simplest trick is to add a hidden section with an item list containing
these methods.
