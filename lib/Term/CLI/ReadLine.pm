=head1 NAME

Term::CLI::ReadLine - maintain a single Term::ReadLine object

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Term::CLI::ReadLine;

 sub initialise {
    my $term = Term::CLI::ReadLine->new( ... );
    ... # Use Term::ReadLine methods on $term.
 }

 # The original $term reference is now out of scope, but
 # we can get a reference to it again:

 sub somewhere_else {
    my $term = Term::CLI::ReadLine->term;
    ... # Use Term::ReadLine methods on $term.
 }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Even though L<Term::ReadLine>(3p) has an object-oriented interface,
the L<Term::ReadLine::Gnu>(3p) library really only keeps a single
instance around (if you create multiple L<Term::ReadLine> objects,
all parameters and history are shared).

This class inherits from L<Term::ReadLine> and keeps a single
instance around with a class accessor to access that single instance.

=head1 CONSTRUCTORS

=over

=item B<new> ( ... )
X<new>

Create a new L<Term::CLI::ReadLine>(3p) object and return a reference to it.

 Check that the newly created newly created L<Term::ReadLine> object is
 of the L<Term::ReadLine::Gnu>(3p) variety. If not, it will call throw a fatal
 exception (using L<Carp::confess|Carp/confess>).

Arguments are identical to L<Term::ReadLine>(3p) and
L<Term::ReadLine::Gnu>(3p).

A reference to the newly created object is stored internally and can be
retrieved later with the L<term|/term> class method. Note that repeated calls
to C<new> will reset this internal reference.

=back

=head1 METHODS

See L<Term::ReadLine>(3p) and L<Term::ReadLine::Gnu>(3p) for the
inherited methods.

=over

=item B<term_width>
X<term_width>

Return the width of the terminal in characters, as given by
L<Term::ReadLine>.

=item B<term_height>
X<term_height>

Return the height of the terminal in characters, as given by
L<Term::ReadLine>.

=back

=head1 CLASS METHODS

=over

=item B<term>
X<term>

Return the latest C<Term::CLI::ReadLine> object created.
